# CardFolio-Services

## Analogy :

A Universal Unique Identified Id card for a user, which can be used as identity provider and various other uses like retailing,data saving,transactions,data exchange etc

## Stack Used :

- Backend :
  - Node JS
  - Express JS
- Databases :
   - MongoDB
   - SQL
- Frontend :
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript
   - EJS Templating

# Software Description :
-  Cards can be used a universal identity for that particular user where we can connect governament ids too.(such as Aadhar card).Each user will be identified as a entity or an object with related dependencies in a stream of databases where each user will have various tasks or openings that he/she can do with their cards : 
   - like medical services.
   - Retailing services.
   - Transactions(Will be common for all the streams).



## Implemented Use Case :
### Considering that we are using this card for Automation of Docter appointment and Medical Prescription Purposes :
#### User Visited a docter, where he/she got some medical prescription from docter which will be updated in our interface by docter, where users have to buy them from their respective medical stores.
- Instead of getting that on a different means of documents, docter can access a subpart of the application (i.e) a particular's users medical section with the universal permission which was given by the developers upon doctor's identity authentication and update prescription in particular user's interface and set the open period for that prescription (This open prescription can be accessed by user to open and close whenever he/she wants to buy those medicines).
- So, in that section open period user can visit nearby medical shop where medical retaier can access users prescription info by user's card details by the authorization of user itself r and gather the required data.
- As mentioned earlier ,the prescription which was satisfied by the retailer can be updated into that particular user's account.

## Future Proceedings :
- Implementing security by integrating encrypted channels (if he concept of transaction is introduced).
- Converting EJS templated frontend to a reactJS application
- Developing  mobile app for users for easy access.
